	Final Product ideas:
		- BRING MONITOR AND SETUP FROM HOME FOR GAME
		- begin with inputting bet amount (2,4,6,8,10...)
		- Menu
			~ visuals
			~ choose suit
			~ choose rank
			~ show their bet card in corner while cards get flipped
		- different sound effects for each amount of points (1, 3, 10)
		- cards flip individually 
		- "+ __ Points!" above card after flip, do for each
		- Recording data
			~ either use program to record data or use spreadsheets(record bet, and player winnings)
			~ may be tough to use program to record data(end screen that shows all the stats after pressing button maybe)
			~ maybe also collect data of how many people get points in each group(0-3, 4-8, 9, 10-15, 16)
		- deck order: clubs, hearts, spades diamonds


				// to do list:
					- need separate lists for rank and suit(guessing separately at start)
					- all working as of right now
					- Console version almost done (base game layout), then make monogame version of it with visuals
