	Final Product ideas:
		- BRING MONITOR AND SETUP FROM HOME FOR GAME
		- begin with inputting bet amount (2,4,6,8,10...)
		- Menu
			~ visuals
			~ choose suit
			~ choose rank
			~ show their bet card in corner while cards get flipped
		- different sound effects for each amount of points (1, 3, 10)
		- cards flip individually 
		- "+ __ Points!" above card after flip, do for each
		- Recording data
			~ either use program to record data or use spreadsheets(record bet, and player winnings, maybe points won aswell)
			~ may be tough to use program to record data(end screen that shows all the stats after pressing button maybe)
			~ maybe also collect data of how many people get points in each group(0 || 1 || 2,3 || 4 || 5,6 || 7,14 || 9,16 || 10,11 || 12,13)
		- deck order: clubs, hearts, spades diamonds (for display in final visuals)
